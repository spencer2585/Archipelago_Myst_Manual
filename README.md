# Archipelago_Myst_Manual
Integration for Myst in Archipelago Randomizer through Manual

This randomizer is designed for use with the Myst Remake on randomized puzzles however it can still be used on any other version of the game or the remake without randomized puzzles.Logic is set up with the assumption that you don't know the answer to puzzles like the clock tower bridge. The only puzzle logic assumes you know the answer to is how to get the white page.
